Dynamic Risk Analyzer™ (DRA) identified issues in several vibration variables associated with rotary equipments for a few consecutive days. 

The engineer who noted these issues recognized that the unit was operating at a higher load than usual, potentially leading to major problems in the future.  In particular, the issues that DRA pointed out for axial vibration variables (mainly associated with compressor and turbine) were indicative of problems caused by conditions that forced the equipments to operate at significantly higher speeds than in the past.  The engineer also noted that no alarms were activated for the vibration variables during this period as they were set significantly far from the current operating range.

> "DRA told us right at the outset when we had started pushing the limits of the equipment.”  – Operations Engineer 

 
The DRA indicators made the operating team aware of these important issues early on, take corrective actions by realigning the equipment, and prompted them to explore ways to run the rotary equipment without sacrificing their reliability and asset longevity when pushing the operating envelope.


Potential Save:

Downtime ranging from two days to several weeks, depending on the severity of the failure

Potential Failure:

Failure of the compressor

What DRA Did:
Identified changes in performance of rotating equipments, before the alarms
