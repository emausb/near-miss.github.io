**Dynamic Risk Analyzer&trade; (DRA)** is groundbreaking enterprise process risk assessment software solution, designed for plant management and engineers to assess the risk level of their plant operations on-demand or periodically. It uses patented methodologies that make use of all the process (online sensor) measurements as well as alarm data. The data is received automatically and is processed to extract crucial risk information that serve as leading indicators of potential shutdowns, accidents, incidents, and operational problems. Put simply, DRA equips the plant operations team with powerful information on the process risk levels that are identified through detection of hidden near-missesTM (which are also described as data-driven near-missesTM). These risk levels change constantly over time and DRA provides detailed information dynamically to address issues long before they result in incidents or operational problems.

Equipped with advanced drill-down capabilities, DRA allows you to find out the sources of the risk – at the lowest levels – to deploy the right resources at the right time and head off potential problems that can impact the bottom line.

The data-centric near-missTM framework enables the parameters used in DRA to update themselves daily. This unique feature enables DRA discover the newest risks as well as their underlying causes. The timeliness and accuracy of DRA will ultimately transform how you assess risk in your plant. Implementation of DRA provides high ROI with minimal resource requirement.
