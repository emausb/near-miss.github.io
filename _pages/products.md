# How it works

What makes us unique is our distinctive, patented approach of identifying hidden near-misses&trade; that are precursors of potential process failures.   

DRA receives data automatically via your existing historian, OPC, or similar systems. The  proprietary, hidden near-miss&trade; technology is designed to manage changes in process over time, updating risk estimates dynamically.  Thus, the latest risk insights are available to all levels of the operations team, including  managers, supervisors, engineers, operators, and maintenance team.  Its easy-to-use web interface, and powerful communication and reporting features, provide transparent and effective risk information exchange among the plant personnel – making DRA a groundbreaking tool for proactive risk detection, predictive maintenance, and effective communication.
