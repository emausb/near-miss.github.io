# How it works

Discover hidden near-misses™ from the entire spectrum of process data. 
{: .text-center}


What makes us unique is our distinctive, patented approach of identifying hidden near-misses™ that are precursors of potential process failures. 

DRA receives data automatically via your existing historian, OPC, or similar systems. All standard data sources (such as OSIsoft Pi, Aspen IP21, Honeywell PHD, GE Proficy, etc.) are supported. With DRA, information on developing risks is available to all levels of your operations team, including managers, supervisors, engineers, operators, and maintenance team.
Result: transparency, proactive risk management, and effective communication.
