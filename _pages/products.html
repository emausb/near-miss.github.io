  <h1>Simple. Powerful. One Platform to Detect All.</h1>

  <strong>Dynamic Risk Analyzer&trade; (DRA)</strong> has been proven to improve safety, reliability, and on-stream efficiency in industrial plant operations. It delivers actionable, early indicators of process issues – typically days and weeks before the alarms go off.  What makes it unique is our distinctive, patented approach of identifying <strong>hidden near-misses</strong>&trade; that are precursors of potential failures. This enables the operating teams to avert problems just when they are beginning to form, to plan predictive maintenance, and to achieve ultimate safety and bottom line.
