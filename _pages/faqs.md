<h3 class="archive__subtitle">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<h2 class="archive__item-title">What are the kinds of tags one can track in the DRA?</h2>
<p>One can track all types of tags that are monitored and recorded continuously in the plant operations. These include temperatures, pressures, flow rates, level indicators, variables associated with rotating equipments, and even your quality variables, which are recorded less frequently. We understand that the sampling frequency of the tags can vary significantly (for example, from 1-sec to 1-day) and that is easily handled by DRA. </p>

<h2 class="archive__item-title">How is data security handled? Because of confidentiality reasons, I cannot let our process data out.</h2>
<p>DRA is designed to ensure that there is no network security issue. Your process data, DRA software copy, as well as the results of the risk calculations – all stay at your site. The information is not on the cloud and stays completely secured within your network firewalls. Only you and your employees have access to that information via your Intranet. We do not have any access to that information once we install the software and leave your site. Further, your IT has complete control over the server. </p>

<h2 class="archive__item-title">What type of hardware is needed for DRA?</h2>
<p>Our server needs are pretty standard. We ask you to provide either a virtual server or physical server.</p>

<h2 class="archive__item-title">How much maintenance is required? </h2>
<p>DRA is very easy to install and maintain, both from IT and Engineering perspectives.</p>
<p>The IT support is only needed before and during the installation. After the installation is complete, there is no IT related maintenance required for the software system. From an Engineering point of view, the system is “self-learning” and all the risk parameters are calculated automatically, so there is no human intervention (and maintenance) required for updating the methodologies and/or parameters.</p>

<h2 class="archive__item-title">What do the users think of the system so far?</h2>
<p>DRA has shown proven success in industrial facilities and our users just love it for its innovation and simplicity. A few quotes from our end-users are as follows: </p>

<p>“Issues are showing up on our radar that reveal something is not right even though our lab results indicate otherwise,” </p>

<p>“DRA reports are used in our morning meetings to point out abnormal areas we need to focus on,” </p>

<p>“DRA allows us to catch deviations that we not have caught looking at averages,” </p>

<p>“DRA told us at the outset when we started pushing the limits of the unit,” </p>

<p>“DRA reports have improved shift-to-shift communications and turnover” and importantly, </p>

<p>“It’s definitely allowing us to catch much more things at much earlier stages than we would have caught otherwise or were catching earlier.”</p>

<h2 class="archive__item-title">This sounds very interesting, what led to the creation of DRA? </h2>
<p>DRA technology has been developed by our founders and technology staff based on over ten years of academic and industrial research. On our website (www.nearmissmgmt.com/resources.html), there are at least 20 scientific publications that show how the idea started and progressed. We also have comprehensive patents in this area. And finally, thanks to our dedicated in-house R&D activities and continuous interaction with customers in different companies and industries, the breadth of problems detected by DRA is increasing as rapidly as ever.</p>
