    <p>The oil and gas industry, which is increasingly facing challenges with profitability, has an opportunity to increase the bottom line with cutting edge early risk detection technologies. Unplanned shutdowns and accidents cost oil production units, aging refineries and gas plants billions every year, taking into account the costs of injuries, stopping and starting production, and customer impact. Statistics show that although on average, a plant operation spends less than 10% of the year in shutdowns, 50+% of process related incidents happen during shutdowns and startups of plants, signifying the critical role of <i>process safety</i> and <i>reliability</i> in today’s operations. </p>   
    <p>Near-Miss Management technology enables oil and gas operations to accurately assess changes in their risk levels, allowing them to anticipate a potential shutdown or incident with advanced warnings than what current solutions can provide. By analyzing the <i>entire</i> spectrum of process data from your plant, our software is able to detect implicit leading indicators of potential problems before they become explicit (observable) issues. Our patented methodology identifies those conditions where the legacy systems or data search assistance tools may be missing the increasing probability of an incident (due to the lack of explicit indicators) by detecting what we call hidden near-misses&trade;.</p>

    <p>No one is more aware than the chemical industry of the unintended consequences of unplanned production disruptions that often lead to incidents. According to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), there are about 300 high-consequence incidents every year in the US chemical industry alone that cause injuries, deaths or greater than $500,000 worth of damage [1].  From the potential loss of life, bodily harm, multi-year contaminations to litigations, insurance claims and damaged corporate image, mitigating risks could not command a higher priority these days. Even lesser incident prevention has been recognized as an operational expense to be targeted, since an unplanned shutdown can cost from the tens of thousands to millions.  </p>
<p>The technology to accurately predict process risks in a timely enough fashion to enable mitigation has only recently become available. Advancements in artificial intelligence, autonomous systems and machine learning have finally matured to a point where industry can extract the answers they need from the reams of data to which they’ve had access. What has been of particular interest to the industry, is the cohesive benefits of this technology, since the same early detection that mitigates risk also optimizes operations and increases productivity, leading to extended life of process and equipment. </p>
<p>At Near-Miss Management, we help chemical companies develop a <i>peripheral risk vision</i> by identifying the changing risk dynamics of their processes and the drivers behind each change. By dynamically monitoring and sifting through the entire spectrum of process data, our software systems identify process risks at their initiation stage, typically days and weeks before humans and alarms. By analyzing the operating conditions holistically and frequently, our methodology identifies unexpected changes and events in the process conditions that can eventually lead to observable near-misses, incidents or accidents. For example, whether a process operation or an equipment is heading towards a risky region can be more accurately understood by looking at the timeline of leading indicators – what we have termed hidden near-misses&trade; – that signal the system is approaching a critical point.  These early data insights help operating teams resolve issues while they are still non-threatening, enabling them to avoid any major issues, thereby achieving increased bottom lines and insurance standings.    </p>

<h2 class="archive__item-title" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom:-10px">Energy</h2>
<img src="/images/industry-03.jpg" alt="Energy"/>
<p>There are numerous electricity production options these days – nuclear, fossil fuels, hydro, wind, solar, geothermal and biomass. With increasing energy demands and available competing options, the most important priority for any power plant is to maximize its <i>reliability</i>, while ensuring its safety.  Reliable plants ensure uninterrupted electricity supply in our homes and communities, which maintains public and political confidence in the power industry. </p> 
<p>However, outages and incidents are not uncommon in the power industry. Statistics on loss history show that mechanical and electrical failure of equipment and components is the main driver for losses and prolonged unplanned outages in power plants. While the age of the equipment has an important bearing on failures, so does poor maintenance procedures. Often there are warning signs, such as excessive vibration, that indicate the equipment is not working properly or is under stress. Unfortunately, these signs are often missed or not recognized before a major problem occurs [1].  </p>
<p>With the new advancements in early risk detection techniques and data analytics, effective risk management can help prevent unplanned outages and incidents at power plants and ensure increased reliability.  Our cost-effective solutions are designed to assist all types of power plants seeking better risk detection and management. Our technology provides leading indicators to operating teams by indicating those instances where potential failure conditions were generated yet actual incidents were avoided. These hidden patterns can help detect when risk levels are beginning to change and what their drivers are. For example, while static models may miss the change in the turbine or compressor patterns, our dynamic analyses flag engineers about slow yet unexpected operating changes, allowing them to resolve issues at their early stages. </p>

<p>Industrial incidents and outages are a serious challenge for the manufacturing industry, leading to decreased profitability, on-stream efficiency, and employee well-being.  The associated reputation risks and under delivered customer needs may have a significant long-term impact on the bottom line and longevity of the company when such production disruptions occur unexpectedly. In addition to the lost revenue opportunity, the total annual costs of injuries resulting from incidents (in the U.S.) are estimated to add up to more than the combined profits of the top 13 Fortune 100 companies [1].</p>
<p>With the new data acquisition and storage capabilities, a typical manufacturing plant now tracks thousands of variables, generating millions of data points every day. Measurements are available on smallest movements of parameters.  However, studies report that only a small percent of this data (typically less than 5%) is used in any type of risk calculations today. Current process risk management have centered mostly around six-sigma or lean management principles. The elements of hidden near-miss analysis and early risk detection, which, in most cases, are not effectively integrated into these management methods, are particularly critical as near-misses hidden in the processes provide true leading indicators. Today’s plants have the opportunity to harness their big data with the cutting edge technologies and to anticipate problems as they are beginning to form.  Near-Miss Management’s patented technology is designed to help achieve this goal as our software systems deliver earliest insights on potential problems, obtained by analyzing from the entire volume of process data.  With easy integration of our solutions into existing workflow, manufacturing facilities can stay focused on early resolution of operating issues and maintain consistent high efficiency and reliability of their operations.</p>
