  <p>In this industry, which is increasingly facing challenges with profitability, the cost of insufficient risk management has become too high to bear. Unplanned shutdowns and accidents cost oil units, aging refineries and gas plants billions every year, taking into account the costs of injuries, stopping and starting production, and customer impact. Add to this major accidents like those in the headlines, and the picture that emerges is one of an industry paying a high price for process risk management issues.</p>
  <p>Our solutions help oil production units, refineries and gas plants more accurately assess changes in the risk levels of their operations, allowing them to anticipate a potential shutdown or incident with more advanced warning. By analyzing all the process data from your plant, our software is able to detect implicit leading indicators of potential problems before they become explicit (observable) issues. Our patent-pending technology identifies those conditions where the systems may be missing the increasing probability of an incident (due to the lack of explicit indicators) by tracking what we call hidden near-misses&trade;.</p>

<h3 class="archive__item-title">Chemical</h3>
    <p>According to the National Response Center, each year, companies in the United States report more than 25,000 fires, spills, or explosions involving hazardous chemicals. At least 1,000 of these events involve death, injury or evacuations. Analysts suggest that for each catastrophic chemical accident that causes a fatality, there are 30 lost-time incidents, 300 recordable incidents, and 30,000 observable near misses. These statistics do not even account for unexpected shutdowns due to all process problems and quality issues, which also influence the reliability of operations.</p> 
    <p>Perhaps even more alarmingly, as the following chart shows, the number of incidents has been rising steadily over the past several years. This suggests that despite all the efforts to improve process management, there is no end in sight to the millions of dollars these incidents cost chemical companies every year.</p>
    <p>At Near-Miss Management, we help chemical companies identify the changing risk dynamics of their processes and the drivers behind each change. By monitoring and sifting through all the process data on real time basis, our software tools identify potential problems that are frequently missed by static models. By analyzing the operating conditions holistically and frequently, our methodology identifies unexpected changes in the process conditions which can lead to observable near-misses, incidents or accidents. For example, whether the parameters of a chemical operation is heading towards a risky region can be more accurately understood by looking at what has been happening and searching for leading indicators – what we call hidden near-missesTM – that signal the system is getting to a critical point.</p>

<h3 class="archive__item-title">Energy</h3>
  <p>In 2011, the NRC reported on 15 significant, observed safety- and securityrelated near-misses at nuclear reactors that prompted the agency to send special investigative teams to analyze problems at those reactors. These events raised the risk of damage to the reactor core — and thus to the safety of workers and the public. According to Union of Concerned Scientists’ latest report’s assertion, the NRC is only able to audit about 5 percent of the activities at nuclear plants in a given year, meaning the problems found represent only a small fraction of the total risks.</p>
  <p>The high profile of nuclear energy and regulatory and public concerns have led to increasing levels of risk management for companies in this industry that cost millions each year, in addition to the actual cost of incidents and accidents. The recently released report on the Fukushima accident will no doubt drive further expensive efforts at nuclear plants to anticipate problems in a more timely manner.</p>
  <p>Our cost-effective solutions can help all types of power plants seeking better risk management. We provide leading indicators by finding those instances where potentially hazardous conditions were generated yet actual incidents and accidents were avoided. These hidden patterns can help anticipate when risk levels are changing. For example, while static models may miss the change in the water flow pattern, our dynamic process information analysis would be able to flag operators and management based on ongoing analysis.</p>

<h3 class="archive__item-title">Manufacturing</h3>
  <p>Industrial accidents are a serious challenge for the manufacturing industry, both in terms of employee well-being and impact on profitability. These types of accidents accounted for more than 1.2 million U.S. employees missing time from work because of nonfatal injuries in 2009 alone, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.1 To put this in context, the total annual costs of injuries from accidents are estimated to add up to more than the combined profits of the top 13 Fortune 100 companies.2 In addition to costs related to employees, damage to equipment and material has a significant impact on the bottom line when these accidents and incidents occur.</p>
  <p>While advances have been made in manufacturing process risk management, both employee and production related, most of these have centered around six-sigma or lean management principles. However, the element of process near-miss management, which, in most cases, is not effectively integrated into these management methods, is particularly critical in the manufacturing environment as near-misses hidden in the processes provide true leading indicators. By easily integrating our solutions into existing risk management methods already in use, manufacturing facilities can equip themselves to better anticipate when processes may be disrupted by factors that are developing and are potentially harmful to employees, equipment and productivity.</p>
