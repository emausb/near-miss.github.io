    <p>The oil and gas industry, which is increasingly facing challenges with profitability, has an opportunity to increase the bottom line with cutting edge early risk detection technologies. Unplanned shutdowns and accidents cost oil production units, aging refineries and gas plants billions every year, taking into account the costs of injuries, stopping and starting production, and customer impact. Statistics show that although on average, a plant operation spends less than 10% of the year in shutdowns, 50+% of process related incidents happen during shutdowns and startups of plants, signifying the critical role of <i>process safety</i> and <i>reliability</i> in today’s operations. </p>   
    <p>Near-Miss Management technology enables oil and gas operations to accurately assess changes in their risk levels, allowing them to anticipate a potential shutdown or incident with advanced warnings than what current solutions can provide. By analyzing the <i>entire</i> spectrum of process data from your plant, our software is able to detect implicit leading indicators of potential problems before they become explicit (observable) issues. Our patented methodology identifies those conditions where the legacy systems or data search assistance tools may be missing the increasing probability of an incident (due to the lack of explicit indicators) by detecting what we call hidden near-misses&trade;.</p>

    <p>No one is more aware than the chemical industry of the dire consequences of industrial incidents. According to Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), there are about 300 high-consequence incidents every year in the US chemical industry alone that cause injuries, deaths or greater than $500,000 damage.  From the potential loss of life and bodily harm, evacuations and multi-year contaminations to on-going litigations, insurance claims and damaged corporate image, mitigating risk could not command a higher priority these days. Even lesser incident prevention has been recognized as an operational expense to be targeted, since an unplanned shutdown can cost from the tens of thousands to millions.  </p>
    <p>The technology to accurately predict process risks in a timely enough fashion to enable mitigation has only recently become available. Advancements in artificial intelligence, autonomous systems and machine learning have finally matured to a point where industry can extract the answers they need from the reams of data to which they’ve had access. What has been of particular interest to the industry, is the cohesive benefits of this technology, since the same early detection that mitigates risk also optimizes operations leading to extended life of process and equipment. </p>
    <p>At Near-Miss Management, we help chemical companies gain a <i>peripheral risk vision</i> by identifying the changing risk dynamics of their processes and the drivers behind each change. By dynamically monitoring and sifting through the entire spectrum of process data, our software systems identify process risks at their initiation stage, typically days and weeks before humans and alarms. By analyzing the operating conditions holistically and frequently, our methodology identifies unexpected changes in the process conditions that can eventually lead to observable near-misses, incidents or accidents. For example, whether a process operation or an equipment is heading towards a risky region can be more accurately understood by looking at the timeline of leading indicators – what we have termed hidden near-misses&trade; – that signal the system is approaching a critical point. </p>

<h2 class="archive__item-title" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom:-10px">Energy</h2>

  <p>In 2011, the NRC reported on 15 significant, observed safety- and securityrelated near-misses at nuclear reactors that prompted the agency to send special investigative teams to analyze problems at those reactors. These events raised the risk of damage to the reactor core — and thus to the safety of workers and the public. According to Union of Concerned Scientists’ latest report’s assertion, the NRC is only able to audit about 5 percent of the activities at nuclear plants in a given year, meaning the problems found represent only a small fraction of the total risks.</p>
  <p>The high profile of nuclear energy and regulatory and public concerns have led to increasing levels of risk management for companies in this industry that cost millions each year, in addition to the actual cost of incidents and accidents. The recently released report on the Fukushima accident will no doubt drive further expensive efforts at nuclear plants to anticipate problems in a more timely manner.</p>
  <p>Our cost-effective solutions can help all types of power plants seeking better risk management. We provide leading indicators by finding those instances where potentially hazardous conditions were generated yet actual incidents and accidents were avoided. These hidden patterns can help anticipate when risk levels are changing. For example, while static models may miss the change in the water flow pattern, our dynamic process information analysis would be able to flag operators and management based on ongoing analysis.</p>

  <p>Industrial accidents are a serious challenge for the manufacturing industry, both in terms of employee well-being and impact on profitability. These types of accidents accounted for more than 1.2 million U.S. employees missing time from work because of nonfatal injuries in 2009 alone, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.1 To put this in context, the total annual costs of injuries from accidents are estimated to add up to more than the combined profits of the top 13 Fortune 100 companies.2 In addition to costs related to employees, damage to equipment and material has a significant impact on the bottom line when these accidents and incidents occur.</p>
  <p>While advances have been made in manufacturing process risk management, both employee and production related, most of these have centered around six-sigma or lean management principles. However, the element of process near-miss management, which, in most cases, is not effectively integrated into these management methods, is particularly critical in the manufacturing environment as near-misses hidden in the processes provide true leading indicators. By easily integrating our solutions into existing risk management methods already in use, manufacturing facilities can equip themselves to better anticipate when processes may be disrupted by factors that are developing and are potentially harmful to employees, equipment and productivity.</p>
