Warren D. Seider is Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. He received a B.S. degree from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Michigan. For many years, he has contributed to the fields of process analysis, simulation, design, and control. In process design, he coauthored FLOWTRAN Simulation - An Introduction (with J.D. Seader and A.C. Pauls) and Product and Process Design Principles: Synthesis, Analysis, and Evaluation (with J. D. Seader, D. R. Lewin, and S. Widagdo). He has coordinated the design project course for over 30 years involving projects provided by many practicing engineers in the Philadelphia area. He is recognized for research contributions in phase and chemical equilibria, azeotropic distillation, heat and power integration, Czochralski crystallization, nonlinear control, and safety and risk analysis. He has authored or coauthored over 110 journal articles and authored or edited seven books.

Professor Seider was the co-recipient (with Professor J. D. Seader) of the AIChE Warren K. Lewis Award in 2004, and the recipient of the AIChE Computing in Chemical Engineering Award in 1992. In 2011, he received the AIChE F. J. Van Antwerpen Award, and in 2008, he was recognized by the AIChE Centennial Committee as one of 'Thirty Authors of Groundbreaking Chemical Engineering Books'. He was elected as a Fellow of AIChE in 2005 and as a Director of AIChE in 1983, and has served as chairman of the CAST Division and the Publication Committee. He helped to organize the CACHE (Computer Aids for Chemical Engineering Education) Corporation in 1969 and served as its chairman.
