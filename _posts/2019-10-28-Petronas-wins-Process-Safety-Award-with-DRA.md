Oil and gas company, Petronas, scooped four out of the eight trophies given at 2019 IChemE’s Malaysia Awards for outstanding achievements in the profession in Malaysia. One of their awards was due to their work with Near-Miss Management’s Dynamic Risk Analyzer (DRA).

Petronas dominated in the Oil & Gas Award and Process Safety Award categories.

> Petronas won the Process Safety Award for its entry, Early Warning Analytics Using DRA. Dynamic Risk Analyzer (DRA) is an analytical tool developed by technology company, Near-Miss Management. The first of-its-kind warning and risk detection software identifies process problems at the initiation stage, allowing personnel to correct issues proactively and prevent unwanted incidents and accidents. Its implementation has helped Petronas develop a culture focused on using insights to make the right decisions in time.  Implementation has already saved RM 10.6m (USD 2.5 million).

The company went on to win the Training and Development Award for its project Process Safety R2C2. Based upon the Influence Model for effective change management, the three-year project has transformed the process safety performance and culture at Petronas Chemicals Methanol. Progress includes a steady decrease in minor releases of material and improved culture and knowledge and capability amongst staff, according to the last process safety survey.

The event was held at the Sheraton Imperial Kuala Lumpur Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on 14 October, 2019. It was attended by special guests the Royal Patron of IChemE Malaysia, Tuanku Zara Salim, and YB Teresa Kok, Minister of Primary Industries.
