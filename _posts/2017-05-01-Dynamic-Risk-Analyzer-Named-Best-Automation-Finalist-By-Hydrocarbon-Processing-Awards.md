> Near-Miss Managementâ€™s early risk detection system, Dynamic Risk Analyzer&trade;, has been designated as a Best Automation finalist by the Hydrocarbon Processing 2017 Awards Program.

 
Sponsored by the editors of Hydrocarbon Processing, the awards program honors the downstream energy segment's leading innovations, as well as outstanding personal contributions to the industry. 

Developed uniquely for the Process and Energy Industries, Dynamic Risk Analyzer &trade;(DRA) is a software platform that delivers advanced warnings on hidden process issues, typically days or weeks before the alarms. It reduces unexpected shutdowns and process failures by uncovering hidden near misses&trade;. What makes DRA unique is its ability to rip through the entire spectrum of process data, uncovering problems, long before humans or alarms can. 

Winners will be announced at a black tie awards ceremony and dinner to be held on June 7, 2017 at the Hilton Vienna Danube Waterfront in Vienna, Austria.
