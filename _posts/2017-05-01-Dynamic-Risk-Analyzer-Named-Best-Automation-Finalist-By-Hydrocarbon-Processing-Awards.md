> Near-Miss Management's early risk detection system for process and energy industry recognized for its pioneering
technology and impact.

Near-Miss Management, pioneering a new era of industrial proactive risk detection systems, today announced
that its Dynamic Risk Analyzer™ (DRA) software has been named a Best Automation finalist by the
Hydrocarbon Processing Awards. The Awards, sponsored by the editors of Hydrocarbon Processing, honors the
downstream energy segment's leading innovations, as well as outstanding personal contributions to the industry.

Developed uniquely for the process and energy industries, Dynamic Risk Analyzer™ (DRA) is a first-of-its-kind
early risk detection software platform that identifies process problems at their initiation stage – enabling
operating teams to take corrective actions proactively, and prevent losses. It delivers advanced warnings on
hidden issues typically days or weeks before the alarms, when the process is still operating under normal
conditions per standard indicators. What makes DRA unique is its ability to rip through the entire spectrum of
process data, uncovering problems, long before humans or alarms can. Ultimately, DRA reduces unexpected
shutdowns and process failures, improves safety and reliability, and boosts operating teams’ productivity.

"We are honored to have Dynamic Risk Analyzer™ be recognized by the editors of Hydrocarbon Processing as
a Best Automation Finalist,” stated Dr. Ulku Oktem, CEO and Co-Founder of Near-Miss Management. "This
recognition validates the profound impact our customers are seeing on a day-to-day basis with our technology
and how it is enabling them to transform their operations to a new status quo.”

Winners will be announced at a black tie awards ceremony and dinner to be held on June 7, 2017 at the Hilton
Vienna Danube Waterfront in Vienna, Austria.
