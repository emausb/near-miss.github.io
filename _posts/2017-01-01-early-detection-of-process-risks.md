> The implementation of a new software, Dynamic Risk Analyzer&trade; (DRA), developed by Near-Miss Management and based on a groundbreaking early risk detection technology, is outlined in this article. DRA assesses the risk level of plant operations and identifies early indicators of developing process problems. By utilising such an early risk detection system, the operating teams can assess and resolve process issues at their initiation stages â€“ driving a proactive risk management culture and workflow. Real-life examples, where process issues were detected and addressed early on using DRA technology, are presented.
