Near-Miss Management co-presented a paper with an Oil & Gas Major (customer) at the 2017 AFPM Reliability and Maintenance conference, held in New Orleans, LA from May 23-26, 2017. The Head of Manufacturing talked about their leadership in establishing a proactive work environment and discussed the successful integration and impact of Dynamic Risk Analyzer technology in their Downstream Operations.    


**Presentation Overview**

*Track:* Reliability

*Time:* Thursday, May 25, 2017, 3:00 - 5:00 pm

Most of the incidents and unexpected process failures can be avoided if the operating teams get timely information about developing risks and take preventive actions early on. In this presentation, the importance of management initiatives and early detection activities to avoid failures was emphasized, highlighting a new technology and software system, Dynamic Risk Analyzer&trade; (DRA). The benefits of DRA (utilized by several customer sites) were presented through real-life examples, demonstrating how the operating teams identified problems at their initiation stages â€“ driving a proactive risk management process, addresssing issues early on, and avoiding unexpected shutdowns. The presentation began with a Technology discussion on integrating different technologies for a harmonious operation. Subsequently, ownership and accountability were emphasized as important management tools to overcome challenges of bringing in new technologies, like DRA, into an existing culture.
