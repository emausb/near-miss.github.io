Near-Miss Management co-presented a paper with PETRONAS at the 2017 AFPM Reliability and Maintenance conference, held in New Orleans, LA from May 23-26, 2017. PETRONAS Chemicals' Head of Manufacturing, Mr. Yusri Yusof, was the presenter of the talk and discussed the successful integration and impact of Dynamic Risk Analyzer technology in Downstream Operations.    

**Presentation Overview**

*Track:* Reliability

*Time:* Thursday, May 25, 2017, 3:00 - 5:00 pm

*Speaker:* Mr. Yusri Yusof, Petronas Chemicals 

Most of the incidents and unexpected process failures can be avoided if the operating teams get timely information about developing risks and take preventive actions early on. In this presentation, the importance of early detection of process issues to avoid failures was emphasized, highlighting a new technology along with a software system, Dynamic Risk Analyzer&trade; (DRA), adopted by PETRONAS. The benefits of DRA were highlighted through real-life examples, demonstrating how the operating teams identified problems at their initiation stages â€“ driving a proactive risk management culture and workflow to identify issues and to avoid unexpected shutdowns.  Importance of management leadership for successful implementation was stressed. 

The first part of the presentation focused on Technology, including a discussion on integrating different technologies for a harmonious operation. Subsequently, ownership and accountability were emphasized as important elements to overcome challenges of bringing in new tools, like DRA, into the existing cultures.
