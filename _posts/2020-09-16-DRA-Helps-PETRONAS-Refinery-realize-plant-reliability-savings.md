PETRONAS Penapisan Terengganu Sdn Bhd (PPTSB), also known as PETRONAS Kertih Refinery, scored the ‘Analytics – Oil & Gas’ award at the recent Malaysia Technology Excellence Awards, presented by Singapore Business Review – demonstrating that the company has unlocked new ways that achieve Operational Excellence through Digital Transformation.

Digitalization in the industrial revolution (IR) 4.0 is crucial for oil and gas companies. With a capacity of 124,000 barrels of crude oil per day, PPTSB’s core business is to refine indigenous crude oil into high value petroleum products for domestic and export markets. PPTSB has taken a leap in IR 4.0 by setting a milestone in PETRONAS digital applications, through three prime projects — Dynamic Risk Analyzer (DRA), PETRONAS Integrated Vision for Operation Excellence Technology (PIVOT), and Plant Operation Integrated Tools (POINT). 

Digital Transformation in PPTSB is guided through technology and digital roadmap, where the projects are deployed to working levels to achieve accelerated results. The transformation journey began with roadmap development to create a 5-year structured timeline for PPTSB to achieve as a world class and empowered organization.
