PETRONAS and Near-Miss Management co-presented a webinar organized by Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE).  

*Time*: Friday, December 15, 2023, 7:30 - 8:30 am ET

**Webinar Overview**

Dynamic Risk Analyzer (DRA) is an autonomous early warning software which is quick to implement, almost like a plug and play system. It provides valuable additional time for operators to identify deviations of individual parameters to troubleshoot potential problems before alarms are triggered. For more complex systems, enhanced monitoring could be achieved via Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). In FTA, process knowledge can be used to provide the relationship among individual tags, to show how these parameters interlink and affect a process plant, much like a Fault Tree normally developed during incident investigation or root cause analysis.

However, instead of being used for post incident investigation it becomes a predictive, pre-incident early warning tool. With the online Fault Tree Analysis, we draw down the experience, tacit knowledge and lessons learnt from previous incident investigations, as well as theoretical knowledge of the process. Years of experience and knowledge are captured, and visualized for enhancement of existing predictive monitoring system. Operations team performing daily monitoring are able to see the potential issues developing from the early stages or the root causes, before they escalate into more concerning issues. Operators are able to visualize the potential faults that could occur, identify the triggered root causes, and are advised with possible prescriptive actions. Thus assessment of the impact of an anomaly and corrective actions could be done more quickly.
