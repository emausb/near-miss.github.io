**About 2019 Hazards Asia Pacific**

The Institution of Chemical Engineers (IChemE) and the Chemical Industries Council of Malaysia (CICM) are pleased to announced the 5th Hazards Asia Pacific conference. As many companies champion on business transformation and digitilisation, new programmes and initiatives are being introduced to maintain competitiveness and stay relevant. Companies are increasing their leverage on technologies and adapting new ecosystems associated with automation and IoT ('internet of things') to drive efficiency. Against this backdrop, process safety culture is reshaping as technology is absorbed into the day to day plant operations. Safety is an integral part of the process industry and it is our responsibility at every level within our organisation. Our core values will continue to drive our process safety culture and safety will remain at the top of leadership agenda. The theme for Hazards Asia Pacific 2019 is Culture, Responsibility and Technology.
