To understand the behavior patterns of managers, engineers, and operators, in Part II, a game-theoretic decision model is developed for a specific plant to balance the advantages and disadvantages of having a Near-miss Management System (NMMS) with different sophistication levels. Assuming that management and engineering preferences differ from those of the process operators, the tradeoffs between them are balanced. As anticipated, it is shown that the choices of the management and engineering team, and the operators, for the selection of a NMMS, are sensitive to the contributing factors. This article introduces a theoretical approach, illustrated using hypothetical data, which should be effective in industrial operations. Attempts to obtain data for validation of the framework were unsuccessful because of confidentiality and liability issues associated with industrial data.
