Dyno Nobel and Near-Miss Management will co-present a paper at the 66th Annual Safety in Ammonia Plants and Related Facilities Symposium, in Chicago, IL from September 12-15, 2022.  

Time: Wednesday, September 21, 2016, 8:30 - 9:00 am

**Presentation Overview**

Achieving zero incidents while maximizing process uptime and efficiency has always been the key vision for Dyno Nobel Waggaman. This paper talks about Dyno Waggaman’s digital transformation journey and the early outcome of their implemented initiatives. 

An important building block towards improving the operational performance and safety is establishment of a proactive risk mitigation culture, supported by effective technologies and sound management workflows. Studies show that most incidents and unexpected process failures can be avoided if the risks are identified at their initiation stage in a way that operating teams get timely information about them and take preventive actions early on. This can be accomplished by having: (1) a proactive management, (2) an effective workflow, and (3) an enabling technology.

At Dyno Waggaman, the management decided to make a change and bring forward the proactive culture. Also, “Dynamic Risk Analyzer&trade;" based on recent breakthroughs in autonomous AI/machine learning, was identified as one of the enabling technologies. Finally, in time, a workflow was established to achieve the best results.
This presentation will focus on the following areas: (1) sharing of management workflows, (2) challenges that were undertaken to help drive a proactive risk mitigation culture, and (3) experience and applications of an autonomous AI/machine learning technology, along with real-life lessons and case studies.  


**About 66th Annual Safety in Ammonia Plants and Related Facilities Symposium**

Organized by AIChE’s Ammonia Safety Committee, the annual symposium is dedicated to improving the safety of plants that manufacture ammonia and related chemicals, such as urea, nitric acid, ammonia nitrate, and methanol. Experts from around the world will discuss the latest advances related to the safe production and use of ammonia, case studies, and lessons learned. Attendees will include plant safety personnel, plant managers, and process engineers representing a spectrum of industries.
