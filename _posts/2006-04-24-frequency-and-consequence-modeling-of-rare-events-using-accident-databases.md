Accident  databases  (NRC,  ATSDR’s,  RMP,  and  others)  contain  records  of incidents  (e.g.,  releases  and  spills)  that  have occurred  in  United  States  chemical  plants during  recent  years.    For  various  chemical  industries,  Kleindorfer  and coworkers summarize  the  accident  frequencies  and  severities  in  the  RMP*Info  database.    Also, Anand  and  coworkers use  data  mining  to  analyze  the  NRC  database  for  Harris County, Texas. 
  
Classical   statistical   approaches   are   ineffective   for   low   frequency,   high consequence events because of their rarity.  Given this information limitation, this paper uses  Bayesian  theory  to  forecast  incident  frequencies,  their  relevant  causes,  equipment involved, and their consequences, in specific chemical plants.  Systematic analyses of the databases also help to avoid future accidents, thereby reducing the risk.  More  specifically,  this  paper  presents  dynamic  analyses  of  incidents  in  the  NRC database.  Probability   density   distributions   are   formulated   for   their   causes   (e.g., equipment  failures,  operator  errors,  etc.),  and  equipment  items  are  utilized  within  a  particular  industry.    Bayesian  techniques  provide  posterior  estimates  of  the  cause  and equipment-failure  probabilities.  Cross-validation  techniques  are  used  for  checking  the modeling, validation, and prediction accuracies.  Differences in the plant- and chemical-specific predictions with the overall predictions are demonstrated.  Furthermore, the NRC database is exploited to model the rate of occurrence of incidents in various chemical and petrochemical  companies  using  Bayesian  theory.    Extreme  value  theory  is  used  for consequence  modeling  of  rare  events  by  formulating  distributions  for  events  over  a threshold value.  Finally, the fast-Fourier transform is used to estimate the risk within an industry utilizing the frequency and severity distributions.
