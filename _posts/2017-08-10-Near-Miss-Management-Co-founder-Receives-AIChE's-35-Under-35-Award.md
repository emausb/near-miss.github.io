Near-Miss Management (NMM) is pleased to announce that Dr. Ankur Pariyani, Co-founder and Chief Innovation Officer, is a recipient of the 35 Under 35 Award from the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).

An initiative of AIChE, Young Professionals Committee, and AIChE Foundation, the 35 Under 35 Award recognizes the significant contributions to the Institute and to the chemical engineering profession of 35 young professional AIChE members who are under the age of 35. The award was created to promote the achievements of this generation of chemical engineers who are changing the face of the profession. 

"NMM congratulates Ankur on being recognized by the AIChE as one of the new generation’s outstanding young leaders in the chemical engineering industry," said Dr. Ulku Oktem, CEO of Near-Miss Management. 

Dr. Pariyani specializes in dynamic risk analysis of large-scale processing plants. His novel work in risk analysis has led to several publications in high-impact journals and industry media, along with two patents. He serves as a referee for several journals and a Guest Editor for the Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries. He holds PhD and MS degrees in Chemical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania and a B.Tech. from the Indian Institute of Technology in Guwahati.

The winners were selected based on their achievements in one of seven categories: bioengineering, chemicals, education, energy, innovation, leadership and safety. In addition to the announcement in the August 2017 issue of AIChE’s flagship magazine, Chemical Engineering Progress (CEP), an awards reception will be held at the 2017 AIChE Annual Meeting in Minneapolis, MN (Oct. 29–Nov. 3, 2017).
