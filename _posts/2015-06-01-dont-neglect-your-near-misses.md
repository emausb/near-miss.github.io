> Use Big Data to find risk assessment gaps & biases

One of the great challenges involving near-miss reporting centers on defining what a near-miss really is in the context of the workplace.

Even if we could all agree on a definition of “near miss,” we could not manage the plethora of data generated from all the near-miss reports in a day, week, or year based on the traditional reporting means we have relied upon over the past decades. And this assumes all near-misses would actually be reported.

I want to introduce you to a new means of discovering operational near-misses before they become near-misses that lead to shutdowns, economic, productivity and property losses, and potentially to major injuries.

This new and proven technology takes information that is constantly being collected, and analyzes it using a series of proprietary calculations. At the start of each day, the plant operations team sees a list of potential process concerns that may warrant attention, even though these process anomalies have not trigged an alarm. The technology has already demonstrated its ability to warn teams of higher risk levels before the situation becomes serious and very costly to address.

The software technology installation only takes a few hours and ensures all plant data remain within the plant’s firewall. The technology is designed for any continuous process facility anywhere in the world, both onshore and offshore.

Traditional methods
Before discussing the technology, let’s discuss some of the methods we have been using to identify high-risk areas to address near-miss scenarios.
