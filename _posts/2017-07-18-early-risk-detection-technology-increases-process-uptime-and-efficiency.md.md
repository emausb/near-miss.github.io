Near-Miss Management will present a paper at the 2017 IRPC Americas Conference, to be held in Houston, TX on July 18-19, 2017. NMM is also pleased to be a co-sponsor of the Welcome Reception on July 18th (Day 1).

**Presentation Overview**

*Track:* Process Control / Automation

*Time:* Tuesday, July 18, 2017, 4:05 - 4:35 pm

Most of the production inefficiencies (incidents, unexpected shutdowns, equipment failure and related operational losses) can be minimized if the operating teams get timely information about developing problems and take preventive actions early on. While advances have been made in process monitoring and automation techniques in the last decade, there still remains significant technological and behavioral gaps that prevent facilities from proactively identifying inefficiencies and reliability issues. In this presentation, the use of a new early risk detection technology and system, called Dynamic Risk Analyzer&trade; (DRA), at a customer site, will be presented. DRA identifies early indicators of developing process issues, when in most cases, the process is still operating within its normal limits.  Typically, process issues get compensated by the control systems that sustain operations, while inadvertently allowing continued deterioration of the underlying root causes until they finally become visible to the Operations team.  DRA identifies such early stage process issues and thereby ensures adequate reaction time (days and sometimes weeks ahead of any alarm) for the operating teams to make required process changes, and avoid late stage and expensive fixes.  

An effective early risk detection system, such as DRA, gives predictive power to the operating teams to resolve process inefficiencies and detect critical issues early on, such as process upsets, equipment deterioration, control/automation issues, operator errors and training gaps, etc.  However, to realize these objectives fully, a proactive management workflow and system must also be in place.  Real-life examples from industrial plants will be shared on how this culture transformation benefits Operations with increased utilization, efficiency and reliability.  Case studies on process issues that were detected early on using DRA technology will be discussed. 

**About IRPC Americas Conference**

For eight years, Hydrocarbon Processing's International Refining and Petrochemical Conference (IRPC) has been the leading downstream technology event.  In todayâ€™s increasingly competitive global HPI, managers and engineers are actively seeking information and solutions to make their organizations more efficient and profitable. Put together in conjunction with an industry-leading advisory board, IRPC Americas Conference and Exhibition will provide a high-level technical forum in which key players in the petrochemical and refinery sector will meet to share knowledge and learn about best practices and the latest advancements in this developing sector of the oil and gas industry. Over the course of two days, attendees will hear from leading executives at top operators and service companies regarding the strategic, technological and operating advancements that can benefit their organization or plant.
