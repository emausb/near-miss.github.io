**About Asian Downstream Summit**

The 10th Asian Downstream Summit is the largest conference and exhibition dedicated to Asia’s refining, petrochemical and chemicals industry. Operators are increasingly turning the spotlight on technologies that can help reduce capital expenditure, reduce risk and optimize asset cost and performance - especially given the current change in feedstock prices. This year’s theme being “Digital Transformation of Refining, Petrochemicals and Chemicals”, the 2017 event will explore how digital, process and catalyst technologies are revolutionizing their operations to reduce costs and maximize efficiency.
