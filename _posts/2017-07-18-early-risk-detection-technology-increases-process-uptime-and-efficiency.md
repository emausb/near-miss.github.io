Near-Miss Management (NMM) will present a paper at the 2017 IRPC Americas Conference, to be held in Houston, TX on July 18-19, 2017. NMM is also pleased to be a co-sponsor of the Welcome Reception on July 18th (Day 1).

**Presentation Overview**

*Track:* Process Control / Automation

*Time:* Tuesday, July 18, 2017, 4:05 - 4:35 pm

Most of the production inefficiencies (incidents, unexpected shutdowns, equipment failure and related operational losses) can be minimized if the operating teams get timely information about developing problems and take preventive actions early on. While advances have been made in process monitoring and automation techniques in the last decade, there still remains significant technological and behavioral gaps that prevent facilities from proactively identifying inefficiencies and reliability issues. In this presentation, the use of a new early risk detection technology and system, called Dynamic Risk Analyzer&trade; (DRA) will be presented. An effective early risk detection system, such as DRA, gives predictive power to the operating teams to resolve process inefficiencies and detect critical issues early on, such as process upsets, equipment deterioration, control/automation issues, operator errors and training gaps, etc. Real-life examples from industrial plants (using DRA technology) will be discussed. 

**About IRPC Americas Conference**

For eight years, Hydrocarbon Processing's International Refining and Petrochemical Conference (IRPC) has been the leading downstream technology event.  In todayâ€™s increasingly competitive global HPI, managers and engineers are actively seeking information and solutions to make their organizations more efficient and profitable. Put together in conjunction with an industry-leading advisory board, IRPC Americas Conference will provide a high-level technical forum in which key players in the petrochemical and refinery sector will meet to share knowledge and learn about best practices and the latest advancements in this developing sector of the oil and gas industry. Over the course of two days, attendees will also hear from leading executives at top operators and service companies regarding the strategic, technological and operating advancements that can benefit their organization or plant.
